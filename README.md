Website featuring a timeline and map of Human History

!!notes:

** some style overrides of the Google Maps Api can be found in App.css**
such as overrides for browser default scrollbar

\*\* custom components require integration with Material UI in order to use theme as a prop,
normally within the custom component the sx prop is available for theme allowing bypassing direct integration, but in the case of
Chart.js another library I just imported the theme object directly
